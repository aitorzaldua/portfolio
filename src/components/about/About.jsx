          <p>
            I have really enjoyed my career up to this point, always with a
            customer first mentality and building solid and, above all, safe
            projects. My experience covers two main blocks: <br />
            12 years of experience as a business continuity and disaster
            recovery engineer, auditing every day the security of their IT
            services and performing annual resilience audits for each client.
            <br />8 years of experience in software development and management
            for IT companies. <br />
            During these stages I have had clients such as JPMorgan, Credit
            Agricole, BBVA, Altura Markets, Inversis, Telefonica/Movistar,
            Vodafone, Adecco among others. <br />
            Passionate about forward-looking challenges, I am currently working
            as a web3 developer, a new technology that fits perfectly with my
            usual priorities: Security, Resilience and Customer Oriented.
